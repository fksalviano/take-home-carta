# Take Home - Carta

Take Home test developed in **C#** with **.NET Core 6.0**.

Using Clean Architecture and Vertical Slice, isolating the Domain of each Use Case. 

### Use Cases

To better exemplify the use of this architecture, the Application Domain was separated on the following use cases:

- **ReadFile**: 
    Responsable to read the CSV file and return itÂ´s content mapped in a list of Domain objects.

- **GetVested**: 
    Responsable to get Vested Schedules based on CSV file content that was mapped and the input Target Date.
    
### Worker

The console application uses a Worker class to orchestrate the Use Cases execution.

### Dependency Injection

The Worker class calls the Use Cases based on interfaces that are injecteds by Dependence Injection.
